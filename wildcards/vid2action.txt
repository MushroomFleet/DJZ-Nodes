walks away from the vehicle
enters through the doorway
looks down with sadness
speaks while moving
unlocks and opens the door
turns around slowly
ascends the staircase
talks on the telephone
walks towards the window
yells from the doorway
knocks on the door
hangs up the phone
stands motionless
enters the room speaking
looks to the right
moves through the crowd
sits at the table
approaches the couch
walks past quickly
turns their head sharply
